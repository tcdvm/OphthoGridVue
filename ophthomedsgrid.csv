Dorzolamide/Timolol,ophthalmic solution,Topical Glaucoma/Ocular hypotensives,"Primary Glaucoma,Secondary Glaucoma,Anterior lens luxation,Posterior Lens Luxation",BID-TID,"* Combination of two glaucoma medications into one drop
* Safe for use in both primary and secondary glaucomas
* Commonly referred to by its trade name ""Cosopt"" (pronounced KO-sopt)
* When given together, dosing of the Dorzolamide (usually TID) can be reduced to a BID dosing schedule
* Comes out as a very viscous and thick eyedrop
* Can sometimes be topically irritating (especially if there's an ulcer present)","* Dorzolamide : Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI)
** Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes conversion of water to bicarb (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+)
* Inhibition of this process leads to lowered concentrations bicarb that then lower sodium and water outflow (aqueous humor production)
* Timolol: Non-selective beta blocker
** Precise mechanism is unknown but suspected to involve cAMP","* Most side effects probably originate from the Dorzolamide
* Can sting after applications due to viscosity and acidity
* Idiosyncratic keratitis has been reported in patients on long-term use with dorzolamide (median time in report was about a year of continued use)
* Dogs with the CAI reaction exhibit marked ulcerative/non-ulcerative corneal neovascularization that was poorly responsive to topical anti-inflammatories

* Mydriasis is handy for use in uveitis as prevention of miosis is useful to prevent secondary glaucoma from posterior synechiae and helps improve vision if miosis is otherwise severe (especially in horses)
* In an uninflamed eye, effect can last for 5-6 days in dogs and cats and potentially weeks in horses

* Blocks receptors at smooth muscle","* Aggressive use is discouraged in cases of dry eye or if secondary glaucoma is a concern
* Parasympatholytic activity reduces tear production
