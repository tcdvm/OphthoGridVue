        "Dose": "q12-48h",
        "Notes": "* Cycloplegic for pain from ciliary body spasm that can occur from uveitis or ulcerative keratitis\n* Mydriasis is handy for use in uveitis as prevention of miosis is useful to prevent secondary glaucoma from posterior synechiae and helps improve vision if miosis is otherwise severe (especially in horses)\n* In an uninflamed eye, effect can last for 5-6 days in dogs and cats and potentially weeks in horses\n* The author will usually dose SID, BID, to EOD depending on degree of uveitis, pain",
        "MOA": "* Nonselective anticholinergic (parasympatholytic)\n* Blocks receptors at smooth muscle",
        "Warnings": "* Aggressive use is discouraged in cases of dry eye or if secondary glaucoma is a concern\n* Parasympatholytic activity reduces tear production\n* Cycloplegia can affect the iridocorneal angle and cause increases in IOP\n* Hypersalivation can be noted if medication is licked from nose (after traveling through nasolacrimal duct) or if travels to mouth, anecdotally ointments may lessen this effect",
